# Zola Deploy Action

A GitHub action to automatically build and deploy your [zola] site to the master
branch as GitHub Pages.

## Usage

```
workflow "Build and deploy on push" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["zola deploy"]
}

action "zola deploy" {
  uses = "shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

## Custom Domain 

If you're using a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site put the CNAME 
in `static/CNAME` so that zola puts it in the root of the public folder
which is where GitHub expects it to be.
